# Data Scientist HR Classification Project
Used Python to classify whether a data scientist was looking or not looking for a job changed. This project was for my graduate-level Data Mining course, STAT 8240, at Kennesaw State University. The project earned a 100% from professor.

## Data Source

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)

## Libraries
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

## Classification Algorithms Implemented
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- Logistic Regression
- Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
- Support Vector Machine

## Results
- The MLP algorithm performed best compared to the 6 other classification algorithms.
- The MLP model with PCA implementated had the best AUC = 0.757 and Recall Score = 0.712.
- The resulting model can help HR and data scientist leaders identify data scientists at risk for leaving their company or help recruiters prepare to onboard new data scientists prior to the resignation company data scientists.
